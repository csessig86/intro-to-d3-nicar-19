### Part 1: Intro to Javascript, D3

#### Intro to Javascript
Javascript is one of the three core technologies on the internet, along with HTML and CSS. It is run in the browser and is primarily used for adding, removing and interacting with elements on a page. In contrast, HTML are the elements on the page, while CSS is used to style these elements.

##### 1. Math, Dates
* The most basic thing you can do in Javascript is math. You can also get the current date and time easily.
```javascript
5 + 10  // returns 15
10 / 5  // returns 2
10 * 5  // returns 50

Math.round(10.7);   // returns 11
Math.max(0, 150, 30, 20, -8, -200); // returns 150
Math.floor(4.7);    // returns 4

new Date() // This equals today's date
```
